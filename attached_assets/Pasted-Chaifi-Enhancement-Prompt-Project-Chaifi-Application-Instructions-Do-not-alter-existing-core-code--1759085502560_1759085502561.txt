Chaifi Enhancement Prompt
Project: Chaifi Application
Instructions: Do not alter existing core code or logic. All features must be added as seamless modules, components, or UI additions. Maintain prior data validations and business rules.

1. Menu Page Enhancements
Add item quantity tracking directly on each menu item card/button.

Display the current count for each item pressed.

Beside each counter, add a “-” button to decrease item quantity (cannot drop below zero).

These quantities reflect in order summary and are used in backend sales calculation.

2. Payment Page
Introduce new payment method: Cash + GPay.

Allow user to split payment on a bill—for example, if total = ₹100, accept ₹10 via GPay and ₹90 via cash.

Ensure this split payment links correctly to sales and receipts in database.

After the total adjustment field, add customizable input fields labeled extras, cooldrinks, and chocolate (staff can type name and amount; fields are customizable).

Add a “Creditor” button:

When pressed, redirect to a Creditor Page (UI to match existing, consistent design).

On Creditor Page: ask for creditor’s name, paid amount, and balance amount.

E.g., If customer Karthik buys ₹50 item as creditor, this appears on bill and in reports as creditor sale.

Future purchases as creditor (e.g., another ₹10 tomorrow) update their total creditor balance and generate correct bills.

Both “Creditors” and “Cash + GPay” payment splits should be staff-customizable in payment page.

3. Dashboard Page
Display summary for all creditors—the amount due should tally correctly.

Add a table at the bottom of monthly/daily summary:

Contains each menu item and today’s sales count.

Provide a bar graph visualizing these sales numbers in the summary report.

All summaries should consolidate:

Total sales

Creditors’ balances

Individual menu item sales

Visual (graph) of item-wise sales

Add, in top left header, a “Clear Data” button:

Options to clear records by day, week, or month.

This should reset data in both frontend and MongoDB backend.

4. Login and Admin Page
After login (username: Inowara, password: Inowara@2025), redirect to admin page.

Admin should be able to:

Insert new menu items

Delete menu items

Update prices

Perform all menu maintenance operations for future use

5. MongoDB Atlas Integration
Connect to MongoDB Atlas using:

Username: chaifimdu_db_user

Password: chaifimdu_db_user@2025

Connection string:
mongodb+srv://chaifimdu_db_user:chaifimdu_db_user@2025@chaifi.1dcy7wl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Chaifi

Access List: Allow all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)

All sales, payments (including split and creditors), menu items, and reports must persist to this DB.

6. Automated Daily Summary PDF
At end of day (window: 3:00 AM to 3:00 PM), generate and email daily sales summary as PDF report to:

Email: chaifimdu@gmail.com

Recipient may be in spam; ensure sending is triggered reliably every day for day’s summary.

Note:

All new fields (extras, cooldrinks, chocolate, creditors, split payments) are staff-customizable and must be supported both in frontend and backend data models.

Bar graph for sales is mandatory in the summary report.

Any additional logic required for reporting, payment splits, clearing data, and custom fields should be added only as new code—do not modify or break existing logic.
