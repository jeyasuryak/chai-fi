1. Menu Page Enhancements
Add item quantity tracking directly on each menu item card/button.

Display the current count for each item pressed.

Beside each counter, add a “-” button to decrease item quantity (cannot drop below zero).

These quantities reflect in order summary and are used in backend sales calculation.

2. Payment Page
Introduce new payment method: Cash + GPay.

Allow user to split payment on a bill—for example, if total = ₹100, accept ₹10 via GPay and ₹90 via cash.

Ensure this split payment links correctly to sales and receipts in database.

After the total adjustment field, add customizable input fields labeled extras, cooldrinks, and chocolate (staff can type name and amount; fields are customizable).

Add a “Creditor” button:

When pressed, redirect to a Creditor Page (UI to match existing, consistent design).

On Creditor Page: ask for creditor’s name, paid amount, and balance amount.

E.g., If customer Karthik buys ₹50 item as creditor, this appears on bill and in reports as creditor sale.

Future purchases as creditor (e.g., another ₹10 tomorrow) update their total creditor balance and generate correct bills.

Both “Creditors” and “Cash + GPay” payment splits should be staff-customizable in payment page.

3. Dashboard Page
Display summary for all creditors—the amount due should tally correctly.

Add a table at the bottom of monthly/daily summary:

Contains each menu item and today’s sales count.

Provide a bar graph visualizing these sales numbers in the summary report.

All summaries should consolidate:

Total sales

Creditors’ balances

Individual menu item sales

Visual (graph) of item-wise sales

Add, in top left header, a “Clear Data” button:

Options to clear records by day, week, or month.

This should reset data in both frontend and MongoDB backend.

4. Login and Admin Page
After login (username: Inowara, password: Inowara@2025), redirect to admin page.

Admin should be able to:

Insert new menu items

Delete menu items

Update prices

Perform all menu maintenance operations for future use
